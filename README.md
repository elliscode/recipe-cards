# recipe-cards

## setup

```
./configure.sh
```

This will clone the https://github.com/elliscode/container-weights-calculator and https://github.com/elliscode/serving-calculator utilities as subdirectories, which the navigation links at the top of the page refer to.

## info

[Working demo here](https://ellisrecipes.com)

Using the generator/index.html page, you can convert a recipe written in markdown to the required HTML used in a recipe card. If javascript is enable in the browser, on loading the page, the recipes will be grouped by category and alphabetically sorted, as well as a search feature enabled, recipe serving modification enabled, and copy buttons will be added to each card.
