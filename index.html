# Bolognese

Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 1 small carrot, peeled, chopped
- 3 TBSP. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat), patted dry
- Kosher salt
- 3 oz. thinly sliced pancetta, finely chopped 1 cup dry white wine
- 1/3 cup tomato paste 1 bay leaf
- 1 Pinch of finely grated nutmeg
- 2 cups (or more) homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth 1 cup whole milk
- 1 lb. fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle, or dry rigatoni
- 2 oz. finely grated Parmesan (about 1/2 cup), plus more for serving

## Preparation

- Pulse onion, celery, and carrot in a food processor until very finely chopped. Transfer to a small bowl.
- Heat oil in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium. Break beef into small clumps (about 11/2") and add to pot; season lightly with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6-8 minutes. It may be gray in spots (that's okay!) and still a little pink in the center. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl.
- Wipe out pot. Cook pancetta in pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until pancetta has released some of its fat and is crisp, 6-8 minutes. Add onion mixture to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and beginning to stick to surface, 6-8 minutes.
- Return beef to pot and pour in wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, smashing down on beef with a wooden spoon, until wine is evaporated, surface of pot is almost dry, and meat is finely ground, 12-15 minutes. (The meat should be reduced to what looks like little bits. It takes a bit of effort, but you can take breaks.) Add tomato paste, bay leaf, and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally and still pressing down on meat, until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 5 minutes.
- Pour stock and milk into pot; add a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until meat is very, very tender, 2-21/2 hours. There shouldn't be any rapid bubbles at this stage. Instead, the sauce should release the occasional small bubble or two. When finished, the sauce should have the texture of and look like a sloppy joe mixture. If the liquid reduces before the meat is completely tender, add an extra 1/2 cup stock and continue cooking. Discard bay leaf. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with salt; keep warm.
- Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. If using fresh pasta, cook about 3 minutes. If using dry, cook until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions.
- Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with sauce. Add 1 cup pasta cooking liquid and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente and liquid is slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
- Transfer pasta to a platter and top with more Parmesan.

Do Ahead: Sauce can be made 4 days ahead. Cover and chill.

# Candied Pecans

Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 6 TBSP brown sugar
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, see notes
- Pinch cayenne pepper, optional
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 TBSP water
- 2 tsp orange zest, optional
- 6 oz pecan halves

## DIRECTIONS

- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
- Add brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, cayenne, vanilla, water, and the orange zest (optional) to a medium skillet.
- Place the skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring often until the brown sugar melts into a bubbling sauce, about 1 minute.
- Stir in the pecans so that the brown sugar sauce coats them.
- Cook, stirring the entire time, until the pecans look candied and smell nutty, 2 to 3 minutes.
- As the nuts heat up in the pan, the sauce will slowly coat them and become shiny. Watch closely as the nuts cook so that they do not burn.
- Transfer the candied pecans to the prepared baking sheet and spread into one layer.
- Allow the pecans to cool down, and then break them up before serving.
- Store cooled candied nuts in an airtight container. They will last at room temperature for one week, in the refrigerator for a few weeks and in the freezer for a month, if not longer.

# Macarons Swiss Method

Servings: 6

## Ingredients

- 150 g white granulated sugar
- 6 g egg white powder optional, read notes below
- 150 g egg whites
- 157.5 g almond flour
- 157.5 g powdered sugar
- Food coloring if desired

## Instructions

### Prep The Ingredients And Tools

- Before you start, get all of the ingredients ready. Prepare a large piping pastry bag, fitted with a large round tip, I use a 1/4" diameter tip, or a Wilton 12. Set aside.
- Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mat.
- I use a baking mat with the macaron template already in it.
- Wipe the tools such as bowls, spatulas, and silicone mats with vinegar if desired, this helps getting rid of any grease particles that might be in the tools.
- Measure out all of the ingredients.
- Sift the powdered sugar and almond flour together. Set it aside.
- Start pre-heating the oven. I pre-heat my large oven to 310F for 60 to 90 minutes, this helps with temperature fluctuations. I pre-heat the countertop oven for 30 to 45 minutes.

### Making The Swiss Meringue

- Place a bowl over a pan with barely simmering water. Add the sugar and egg white powder to the bowl if using. If you're not using egg white powder simply skip it, nothing needs to be changed in the recipe.
- Whisk the sugar and egg white powder so it doesn't clump up.
- Add the egg whites to the bowl and whisk until the sugar is completely melted. It will take a couple of minutes. You can test by touching the mixture between your fingers, and if you feel any sugar granules just keep whisking the mixture over the water bath.
- Make sure the bottom of the bowl isn't touching the simmering water because you don't want the whites to cook.
- Also, don't overheat the sugar syrup, you are just looking to melt the sugar, no need to bring it to a certain temperature.Transfer the syrup to the bowl of a stand mixer. Before transferring the syrup, you might consider whipping the bottom of the bowl with a towel so the water doesn't fall into the mixer bowl.
- With the whisk attachment, start whisking mixture on low (speed 2 of the KitchenAid) for about 30 seconds, then gradually start increasing speed to medium. Whisk on medium (speed 4) for one to two minutes, until the mixture is white and starting to become fluffy. Raise the speed to medium or medium-high and whip for a few minutes until stiff peaks are formed. I like to finish whipping the meringue on speed 6 of the KitchenAid.
- It takes me about 13 to 15 minutes to whip the meringue, but you shouldn't go by time, go by what the meringue is supposed to look like because a lot of things can affect whipping time, such as the quality of the eggs, the weather, how powerful your mixer is, and more.
- Once the meringue gets glossy and you start seeing streaks formed by the whisk, and the meringue raising in the center of the whisk, it might be time to stop.
- You don't want to over whip the meringue at this point because that can cause several issues, mainly hollow macarons.
- Whisk until stiff peaks have formed. When you pull the whip up, the peak should be stiff and shooting straight up, with possibly a slight bend at the top, but not bending to the side.
- Also when you swirl the whisk around in the bowl to collect the meringue, you should feel some resistance from the meringue. And when you look on the bottom of the whisk the meringue collected should be forming soft but defined waves.

### Macaronage

- Pour the sifted powdered sugar and almond flour into the stiff meringue.
- Add the food coloring at this point, if using. If you were using powder food coloring, you could add it during the final stages of whipping the meringue.
- Start folding gently forming a letter J with a spatula.
- Once the dry ingredients have incorporated with the meringue, you can start squeezing the air out of the batter by pressing it down along the sides of the bowl as you fold.
- How to know when to stop folding the batter: It's time to stop folding when the batter is glossy and has a thick and flowing consistency. There are several ways to test this.
- First, pick up some batter with the spatula and try to draw a figure 8 with the batter that is dripping off the spatula. If you can form several 8 figures without the batter breaking up, that's one indication that it might be ready.
- The batter that's falling back into the bowl should take 10 to 15 seconds to incorporate with the batter that's already in the bowl.
- There's another test you can do. I call it the tsp test. Grab a tsp of batter and spoon onto the parchment paper or silicon mat. Wait a minute to see how it behaves.
- If the batter stays stiff, forming a point and doesn't spread out, fold a little bit more, about 3 folds.
- Test again.
- Once the batter spreads out a bit and starts to look glossy and smooth on top, on the parchment paper or silicone mat, it's ready.
- You don't want your batter to be too runny either. So be careful not to over mix. It's always best to under mix and test several times until the proper consistency has been achieved.
- When you hold the spatula with batter on top of the bowl and the batter falls off the spatula slowly but effortlessly the batter is ready. The batter will keep flowing off the spatula non-stop, but not too quickly.
- Transfer the batter to the piping bag. I also like to seal the top with a bag tie, so the batter doesn't dry out and it gives you more control while piping because there's no risk of the batter escaping through the top of the piping bag.
- Place the piping bag directly 90 degrees over the center of each macaron template. Apply gentle pressure and carefully pipe for about 3 to 5 seconds, and then quickly pull the bag up twisting slightly at the top.
- Once you've piped as many circles as you could, bang the trays against the counter or against the palm of your hand a few times each.
- Use a toothpick to pop any air bubbles in the surface of the shells.

### Resting Or Not Resting The Shells

- Let the trays sit for a while so the shells will dry out before baking, if you are resting the macarons. I usually leave about 20-40 minutes, depending on how humid the day is. You'll know they're ready when you gently touch the surface of a macaron and it seems dry.
- To do the no-rest method, you can bake the trays immediately.
- The no-rest method will depend on your oven and baking sheets you are using. Read the post above for more information.
- I can do the no-rest method on my small counter top oven, but not on my large oven, because the temperature is too uneven on the large oven.

### Baking

- On my large oven I bake the macarons at 310F, and on the small countertop oven I bake them at 290F. I pre-heat both ovens for quite a bit of time. I pre-heat the large oven for 60 to 90 minutes, and the small oven for 30 minutes or so.
- Bake one tray at a time.
- Bake for 5 minutes, rotate the tray. This step is not necessary, I don't rotate the trays on the small oven, but I have to do so on my large oven, otherwise the macarons will be lopsided. Not all bakers have to rotate the tray.
- I bake each tray for about 15 to 20 minutes.
- When baked, the macarons will have a deeper color and formed feet. If you try to move a macaron, it shouldn't feel jiggly. If the macaron is still jiggly, keep baking. Also try to touch the top of a macaron and it shouldn't feel soft, if it's still soft, keep baking.
- Remove from the oven and bake the other tray.
- Let the macarons cool down before proceeding with the filling.

# Vegan Macarons

Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 75 g aquafaba (water from a chickpea can)
- 110 g almond flour
- 110 g powdered sugar
- 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
- 66 g granulated sugar

## Directions

- preheat oven to 270F fan
- whip aquafaba to soft peaks
- add granulated sugar, cream of tartar, and food dye and whip until past stiff peaks, like really way too thick, overwhipped
- overwhip the meringue
- Gather all of the ingredients before starting to make macarons. Measure out all ingredients. Line two baking sheets with silicon mats. And fit a large piping bag with a large round tip, I use a 0.5" diameter. You want everything ready to go when you need it.
- Sift the almond flour and powdered sugar together. Set aside.
- Place the aquafaba and cream of tartar in the bowl of a mixer.
- Start whipping on low speed for about 2 minutes, until it starts to get white and thick.
- At this point, raise speed to high, start to add granulated sugar, slowly, a bit at a time.
- Continue to whip until the aquafaba achieves stiff peaks.
- The whole whipping, from beginning to end, should last about 10 minutes. It can last more or less time depending on what mixer you are using, and what speed.
- Add the sifted dry ingredients to whipped aquafaba. Start folding with a spatula slowly.
- Add food coloring at this point, if using any.
- Fold forming a letter J with the spatula.
- Fold until the batter is flowing slightly. You don't want the batter to be flowing continuously off the spatula. When it comes to vegan macarons, the folding time is very very brief. You are basically just looking to incorporate the dry ingredients with the meringue. Please watch the video to see what the consistency should look like. If you grab a spatula full of batter and hold it over the bowl, it should still be separating in chunks, and not flowing continuously on a ribbon. Do not get to the ribbons stage! If you get to the ribbon stage, the macaron feet will spread out in the oven.
- Transfer the batter to the piping bag.
- Pipe 1.5" circles on a baking sheet lined with silicon mat. I usually use 2 sheets. This will depend on how big you pipe your macarons.
- Bang the trays against the counter to release air bubbles.
- Use a toothpick to pop any remaining bubbles.
- If using sprinkles, make sure to sprinkle them before the macaron shells dry. Sprinkle them on half of the sprinkles, as you will want the other half to be used as the bottom of the macaron sandwich.
- Let the trays rest for 30-45 minutes until the shells are dry. Test this by touching a macaron gently with your finger. Depending on humidity levels and weather, it might take longer or less time for your macarons to dry.
- Pre-heat oven to 285F.
- Bake one tray at a time.
- Bake for a total of 20 minutes, or until the macarons are easily coming off the silicon mat.
- Remember to rotate the tray every 5 minutes, to ensure even baking.
- Baking time might vary depending on your oven.
- Let macarons cool down before filling.

# Custard Pie

Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 1 pie crust, bottom only
- 340 g milk
- 227 g cream, heavy, whipping, light, or half-and-half, your choice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 large eggs
- 131 g sugar
- 1 TBSP vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg

## Directions

- Start by combining the milk, cream, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan or microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture until small bubbles form around the edges, and steam starts to wisp from the surface; this is how you "scald" milk, if you've ever seen that technique mentioned.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar. Pour 1/4 of the hot milk/cream over the egg mixture, stirring well. Pour the egg mixture into the remaining hot milk/cream, stirring well. Pour the custard through a sieve, to strain out any possible bits of cooked egg. Stir in the vanilla extract.
- Pour the hot filling into the baked, cooled crust. Sprinkle the nutmeg evenly over the top. Cover the edges of the pie with a pie shield or strips of aluminum foil to prevent over-browning.
- Place the pie onto your oven's middle rack and bake it for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the custard is set at the edges but still a bit wobbly in the center. The temperature of the pie at the center should be between 170F and 180F.
- Remove the pie from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool. When it's completely cool, refrigerate until you're ready to serve.
- Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for several days.

# Almond Cake

Servings: 12

## Ingredients

- 2 sticks butter
- 400 g sugar
- 3 medium eggs at room temperature
- 3 medium egg yolks at room temperature
- 3 TBSP vegetable oil
- 1 tsp almond extract
- 10 oz milk
- 390 g ap flour
- 1 TBSP baking powder
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions

- Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or three 8-inch round cake pans, lining the bottoms with parchment paper rounds for easy release.
- In the bowl of your stand mixer whip the butter on medium high speed until very smooth. Add the sugar and mix on high speed until fluffy and creamy. The sugar will start to dissolve into the butter a little bit during this creaming process, so you should be able to feel the grains of sugar getting smaller.
- Add the eggs and egg yolks one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl regularly at this stage to make sure everything is mixed well.
- Mix in the oil and almond extract on low speed.
- Measure the buttermilk into a liquid measuring cup and and set aside.
- Measure and sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a separate bowl and combine with a wire whisk.
- Add the dry ingredients and the buttermilk alternatively while the mixer is running on low speed. Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients, half the buttermilk, another 1/3 of the dry ingredients, the other half of the milk, and the remaining dry ingredients.
- Turn the speed of the mixer to medium-low and mix until the batter is smooth.
- Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans and bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for about 29-34 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of one of the cakes comes out clean.
- Cool the cakes in the pans for about 5-7 minutes and then turn them out onto cooling racks to cool completely.
- Once the cakes are cool, store them wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge until ready to frost. They should be refrigerated for at least 1 hour before frosting.

# Vanilla Cake

Servings: 12

## Ingredients

- 300 g plain / all purpose flour
- 2.5 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 large eggs
- 300 g caster / superfine sugar
- 115 g / 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 250 g milk
- 3 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 tsp canola oil

## Directions

### Preparation

- Preheat oven to 180C/350F for 20 minutes before starting the batter. Place shelf in the middle of the oven.
- Grease 2x20cm / 8" cake pans with butter, then line with parchment / baking paper. Best to use cake pan without loose base, if you can.

### Combine Dry Ingredients

- Whisk flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.

### Beat Eggs Until Aerated

- Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a Stand Mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or hand beater.
- With the beater still going, pour the sugar in over 45 seconds.
- Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8, or until tripled in volume and white.

### Finish Cake Batter

- Heat Milk-Butter: While egg is beating, place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter. Do not let milk bubble and boil. Don't do this ahead and let the milk cool.
- Gently add flour: When the egg is whipped, scatter 1/3 flour across surface, then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add half remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 - 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can't see flour, stop straight away.
- Lighten hot milk with some Egg Batter: Pour hot milk, vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 1.5 cups of the Egg Batter into the Milk-Butter. Use a whisk to mix until smooth - you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy.
- Slowly add milk: Turn beater back on Speed 1 then pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds, then turn beater off.
- Scrape and final mix: Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds - batter should now be smooth and pourable.

### Bake

- Pour batter into pans.
- Knock out bubbles: Bang each cake pan on the counter 3 times to knock out big bubbles
- Bake 30 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean.

### Cool And Frost

- Remove from oven. Cool in cake pans for 15 minutes, then gently turn out onto cooling racks. If using as layer cakes, cool upside down - slight dome will flatten perfectly. Level cake = neat layers.
- Frost with frosting of choice, or cream and fresh berries or jam. See list of ideas in post!

- 39 g vital wheat gluten
- 8 g instant yeast
- 10 g kosher salt
- 455 g 110F water

- add water and mix with rubber spatula until dough ball forms
- coat in a small amount of olive oil, then cover and refrigerate overnight
- the next day, grease two pie pans with Butter
- pour a TBSP of olive oil in the center of each pan
- Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough ball. Use the forks to split the dough into two equal pieces. Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the remaining piece. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen.

If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow the dough to fill the pan. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over.
- Transfer the pans to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the underside is golden and crisp. Remove the pans from the oven and transfer the focaccia to cooling racks. Let it cool for 10 minutes before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are halving it with the intention of making a sandwich.

# Cherry Pie Filling

Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 5 to 6 cups fresh pitted cherries, about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 TBSP freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 4 TBSP cornstarch

# Ermine Frosting

Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 37.5 g all purpose flour
- 200 g white sugar
- 240 g cup milk
- 1.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 sticks unsalted butter

### Chocolate Frosting Option:

- 1/4 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened

### Cinnamon Frosting Option

- 1 tsp ground cinnamon

### Candy Cane Frosting Option

- 2 candy canes, melted in with milk

### Lemon Frosting Option

- 2 TBSP lemon juice
- 2 tsp lemon zest
- 2 TBSP meringue powder

### Peanut Butter Frosting Option

- 1.5 sticks unsalted Butter
- 67 g smooth peanut butter

### Oreo Frosting Option

- 6 oreos blended in with milk
- 6 oreos crushed and added to frosting after mixing

### Prosecco Frosting Option

- 320 g prosecco, reduced on low heat
- 30 g prosecco after reduction

### Peach Frosting Option

- 200 g frozen peaches, thawed and blended with milk
- 240 g should be total weight after you simmer the milk and fruit mixture

### Candied Pecan Option

- replace white sugar with brown sugar
- 1 recipe of candied pecans, blitzed in food processor

## Instructions

### Thickening Roux:

- Place flour and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.
- While whisking constantly, slowly pour the milk in.
- As the milk gets hotter, it will start to thicken - stir constantly so the base doesn't catch.
- Cook until the mixture thickens in a thick, dolloping custard - see video for texture. TIP: Thicker texture = thicker frosting texture but won't make the frosting dense, it's still fluffy and spreadable but it just makes it "sturdier" with sharper edges when piped.
- Remove from heat and scrape into a bowl. Cover with cling wrap, pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming.
- Cool completely. You can leave in fridge overnight but take it out 1 hour prior to using.

### Making The Fluffy Frosting:

- Place butter in a bowl and use either a handheld beater or stand mixer to beat for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow, almost white.
- Now start whipping in the Thickening Roux. On speed 5, start adding the thick roux one heaped TBSP at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all.
- Once all added, add vanilla and salt, then whip for 2 to 3 minutes until you can see that it is still enough to hold peaks. Then it's ready to use!

### Chocolate Flavoured Option:

- Beat in the cocoa powder at the end, just until mixed through.

# Chocolate Cupcakes

Servings: 14

## Ingredients

- 94 g all-purpose flour
- 45 g unsweetened natural cocoa powder
- 3/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature*
- 100 g granulated sugar
- 100 g packed light brown sugar
- 1/3 cup vegetable or canola oil
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup buttermilk, at room temperature*

## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners. Line a second pan with 2 liners - this recipe makes about 14 cupcakes. Set aside.
- Cupcakes: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla together until combined. Pour half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Then half of the buttermilk. Gently whisk for a few seconds. Repeat with the remaining wet ingredients and buttermilk. Stir until *just* combined; do not overmix. The batter will be thin.
- Pour or spoon the batter into the liners. Fillonly halfway to avoid spilling over the sides or sinking.
- Bake for 18-21 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting. I usually let them cool in the pan.
- Frost cooled cupcakes however you'd like. I used chocolate buttercream and Wilton 1M piping tip for these pictured cupcakes. Top with sprinkles, if desired. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

# Tsoureki

Servings: 2

## Ingredients

### For The Dough

- 24 g dry yeast
- 110 g lukewarm water
- 3 g ground mastic
- 10 g ground mahleb
- 135 g butter, from cow's milk,
- 230 g sugar
- 150 g milk, at room temperature
- 4 medium eggs, at room temperature
- 870 g strong white flour
- zest of 1 orange

### To Garnish

- 1 egg and 1 TBSP water
- almond slivers

### For The Syrup

- 150 g sugar
- 150 g water

## Instructions

- To prepare this tsoureki recipe, add in a bowl the lukewarm water, a pinch of sugar and yeast and stir. Wrap well with plastic wrap and set aside for about 6-7 minutes, until the yeast rises and starts bubbling. Be careful not do add hot water, as it will kill the yeast, nor cold, as it will take forever for the Greek Easter bread to rise. The water should be at the same temperature as your finger, so check it out sticking one finger in; you should feel no difference in temperature.
- Use a pestle or a blender to ground the masticha and mahlepi, along with a pinch of sugar and set aside. These aromatic spices will give Greek Easter bread its distinctive taste and amazing smell. But be careful not to add any more mastic than this tsoureki recipe calls for, as it will leave a slightly bitter taste to your Greek Easter bread.
- In a saucepan add the butter, sugar and milk. Place over very low heat and stir the mixture, until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. The key is to melt the butter at very low heat, so that the temperature doesn't 'kill' the yeast.*Remove the pan from the stove and check the temperature. The mixture should be lukewarm - the same temperature as your finger. If it is warmer, leave to cool down for a few minutes and check again.
- Pour the butter mixture in a large bowl and whisk in the eggs. Add the yeast mixture and whisk to combine.
- In the mixer's bowl add the flour, the ground mastic and mahlepi, orange zest and the butter-egg-yeast mixture from step 4. Using the dough hook mix at first at low speed, until the ingredients start to combine and then mix at medium-high speed for about 15 minutes, until the dough doesn't stick on the sides of the bowl. At this point the dough should be really soft, like seen in the picture and a little sticky..
- Cover the dough with plastic wrap and place in a warm environment, until at least it doubles in size. If the environment is cold, preheat the oven at 30C/85F, turn it off and place the bowl inside.
- Gently deflate the tsoureki dough with your hands and cut in 6 equal portions. Take one piece of the dough and roll it a little with your hands. Hold with your hands from the edges and shake to stretch the dough into a rope. This technique will help the Greek Easter bread form the characteristic stringy texture, as seen in the picture.
- Form the Greek Easter bread into a braid and transfer on a large baking tray layered with parchment paper. Repeat the same procedure with the second tsoureki. Let the Greek Easter bread rise for about 1 more hour at room temperature or in the oven, until it puffs up and almost*doubles in size, like in the pictures.
- In a small bowl add the egg and 1 TBSP water and whisk with a fork. Brush the top of each Greek Easter bread with the egg, being careful not to deflate it, garnish with almond slivers and bake in preheated oven at 150C / 310F fan for about 30-40 minutes, until nicely browned and fluffy. If its getting too brown too quickly cover with some parchment paper and continue baking.
- Although the traditional tsoureki recipe doesn't call for syrup, garnishing Greek Easter bread with just a little syrup, always gives a little something! So it's up to you to decide! Prepare the syrup for the Greek Easter bread just right before you turn the tsoureki out of the oven. In a small pot add the sugar and water and bring to the boil. As soon as the sugar dissolves, remove the pot from the stove and ladle the hot syrup over the hot tsoureki.
- Let the Greek Easter bread cool down and wrap well with plastic wrap, so that it doesn't become hard and dry. Store for up to a 5-6 days at room temperature or up to a couple of months in the freezer.

# Carrot Cake

Servings: 12

## Ingredients

### Carrot Cake

- 312 g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 300 g dark brown sugar
- 100 g granulated sugar
- 215 g canola oil
- 4 large eggs, room temperature
- 260 g applesauce, unsweetened, room temperature
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 260 g carrots, finely shredded
- 228 g pecan halves

### Brown Butter Cream Cheese Frosting

- 16 oz cream cheese, room temperature
- 1 stick unsalted butter, browned on the stove
- 568 g powdered sugar, unsifted
- 1 TBSP heavy cream or milk
- 1.5 tsp pure vanilla extract
- pinch of salt

## Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350F. Place pecans on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 7 minutes, then chop with a pastry cutter. set aside
- Shred whole carrots using a box grater or food processor using the smaller, finer holes. Make sure to shred at home because pre-shredded carrots are generally dried out, and we need the moisture of the freshly shredded carrots for the cake.
- Preheat the oven to 350F. Grease three 9" round cake pans and line with parchment paper. I like to cut circles of parchment to fit snug at the bottom. Grease again over the parchment and on the sides.
- In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, eggs, apple sauce, and vanilla.
- Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined, avoiding overmixing. Fold in shredded carrots and half the pecans until evenly combined. Pour cake batter into the 3 baking pans, ensuring they weigh approximately the same.
- Bake the cakes for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. If the toothpick comes out wet, continue baking until cooked thoroughly, but be careful of overbaking. When done, invert the cakes out of their pans onto a cooling rack. Peel off the parchment paper to allow steam to escape faster. Cool the cakes completely before frosting.
- Melt unsalted butter in a saucepan over medium heat until the butter gets a tint of brown, not too dark, about 10 minutes. It will smell nutty and delicious! Pour into a heat-safe bowl, and cover at room temp to solidify.
- Using a hand mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat together the solidified brown butter and cream cheese until smooth but not whipped. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, milk, and salt. Beat on low speed until the powdered sugar is incorporated, then increase speed to medium-high until creamy but not whipped, ~1-2 minutes. Add more powdered sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if too thick, or another pinch of salt if too sweet. Frosting should be smooth but not runny.
- Using a long serrated knife, level off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Add a spoonful of frosting to the center of your cake stand or serving plate to keep the cake in place. Place the first layer on the stand and add an even layer of frosting on top. Spread to cover the entire top surface. Repeat with the second and third layer. Spread remaining frosting over the sides of the cake. Decorate the cake with the rest of the toasted pecans. Refrigerate cake for at least 15-20 minutes to set before cutting. Store in a fridge to enjoy for up to 5 days. Don't leave it out overnight since the frosting has cream cheese in it.
